# Summary

The Summary provides a simple, textual overview of the current corpus, including (as applicable for multiple documents) number of words, number of unique words, longest and shortest documents, highest and lowest vocabulary density, most frequent words, notable peaks in frequency, and distinctive words.

## Overview

The Summary displays 6 categories of information formatted in a bulleted list.

1. The first bullet provides an overview of the corpus, including number of documents in the corpus, number of words in the corpus, and number of unique words in the corpus.
1. The second point provides the top two longest documents (by number of words) in the corpus, and the top 2 shortest documents. Following each tittle the actual number of words is provided in brackets. As well the point illustrates the distribution of document length across the corpus through a small thumbnail pic just to the right of the point’s keyword. This line graph shows the documents in the order that they were added, and not for example in the order of longest to shortest text.
1. The third point provides the documents with the top two vocabulary densities, and the documents with the lowest two. Following each title the vocabulary density for the document is indicated in brackets. As well the point illustrates the distribution of vocabulary density across the corpus through a small thumbnail pic just to the right of the point’s keyword. This line graph shows the documents in the order that they were added, and not for example in the order of highest to lowest vocabulary density.
1. The fourth point indicates the five most frequent words in the corpus, with their frequencies indicated to their right in brackets.
1. The fifth point indicates the five words with the most notable peaks in frequency. The word’s frequencies are indicated to their right alongside a small thumbnail pic depicting their relative frequencies across the corpus.
1. The sixth point indicates the top five most distinctive words of each of the documents. While only the first five documents are visible clicking “Next # of # remaining” allows the user to navigate through the remaining undisplayed documents. To the right of each of the words is the word’s frequency displayed in brackets.
