# WordTree

The Word Tree tool allows you to explore how keywords are used in different phrases in the corpus.

## Overview

By default, the most common term is used as the first word tree root.

You can click on terms to expand or collapse further branches, when they're available. Double-clicking on a term should trigger a phrase search in other Voyant panels (if applicable).

<div style="width: 90%; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;">WordTree with the Works of Jane Austen. You can also <a href="../?view=WordTree" target="_blank">use WordTree with your own corpus</a>.</div>

## Options

You can set the root term in the tree by typing a query into the search box and hitting enter (see [Term Searches](#!/guide/search) for more advanced searching capabilities).

Clicking on the [Options](#!/guide/options) icon allows you to define a set of stopwords to exclude â€“ see the [stopwords guide](#!/guide/stopwords) for more information.
