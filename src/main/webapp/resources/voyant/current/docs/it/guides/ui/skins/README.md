1. [Cirrus](#!/guide/cirrus)

1. [Summary](#!/guide/summary)
1. [Contexts](#!/guide/contexts)


<iframe src="../?corpus=austen" style="width: 90%; height: 600px;"></iframe>
<div style="width: 90%; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;">Voyant with the Works of Jane Austen. You can also <a href="../" target="_blank">use Voyant with your own corpus</a>.</div>

The various tools in the interface are designed to interact with one another. For instance, if you click on a word in [Cirrus](#!/guide/cirrus), youâ€™ll see the [Trends](#!/guide/trends) tool update with information about the selected work. Similarly, if you click on a node in the [Trends](#!/guide/trends) tool the [Contexts](#!/guide/contexts) tool should update as well. Interactivity and navigation between the different scales of a corpus (from the macroscopic [Cirrus](#!/guide/cirrus) overview to the microscopic individual word occurrences) are a key part of the design of Voyant Tools.

Additional tools are readily accessible by clicking the tabs in each tool pane. For instance, beside the [Cirrus](#!/guide/cirrus) header label is the [Corpus Terms](#!/guide/corpusterms) label, clicking on the tab will switch the tool. Tools readily available through the tabs are [Corpus Terms](#!/guide/corpusterms), [Links](#!/guide/collocatesgraph), [Collocates](#!/guide/corpuscollocates), [Documents](#!/guide/documents), [Phrases](#!/guide/phrases), and [Bubblelines](#!/guide/bubblelines).

Beyond the tools visible in the tabs, it's possible to access most of the other tools available by clicking on the window icon that appears when the mouse is in the header of a tool (grey) or of the skin (blue). The menu that appears shows recommended tools for that location above the line and a hierarchy of other tools below the line.
