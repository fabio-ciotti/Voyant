# Bubbles

Bubbles is a playful visualization of term frequencies by document.

High frequency terms are read in document order, and the current term is shown in the upper right-hand corner. The list of terms below shows a ranking of the cumulative frequencies to that point in the document. The first time a term is encountered a bubble is created and added to the main part of the canvas. The term flashes in yellow as it's being read. The relative size of the bubbles indicates the frequency compared to other terms to the current point in the document.

The total number of terms to be read is shown at the bottom, along with a progress bar. If the corpus is composed of multiple documents, the next document will automatically be fetched and read.

You can hover over a bubble term to see its frequency to that point. You can also drag the bubble to move it if you wish.

## Options

You can switch to a different document by selecting it in the Documents selectors.

You can adjust the speed of the visualization using the speed slider. This is essentially the frame rate of the visualization, from 1 to 60 frames per second.

You can toggle audio by using the sound checkbox. The higher the frequency of the term currently being read the higher the frequency of the sound.

Clicking on the [Options](#!/guide/options) icon allows you to define a set of stopwords to exclude â€“ see the [stopwords guide](#!/guide/stopwords) for more information.

## Additional Information

Bubbles is an adaptation of Martin Ignacio Bereciartua's excellent [Letter Pairs](https://www.m-i-b.com.ar/letters/en/). Changes include having it display words instead of letter pairs, adding sound, making it resizable, selective showing of term information, and performance tweaks.
