# What's New

Voyant 2.0 is a complete rewrite of both the user interface and the server-end components. The following is an overview of some of the more significant changes:

* a cleaner, crisper appearance
* better cross-platform and mobile device support (all tools in HTML5, no Flash or Java Applets)
* [advanced search](#!/guide/search) capabilities, including wildcards, phrases, and proximity queries
* a new [tables/grids](#!/guide/grids) framework that allows for infinite scrolling (instead of the awkward paging and favourites from before)
* modifying a corpus adding and reordering documents
* new [Phrases](#!/guide/phrases) tool for analyzing repeating n-grams
* much better support for larger corpora
* vastly improved performance throughout (corpus reader and collocates are notable examples)
* built-in documentation for the current version (that you're currently reading)
